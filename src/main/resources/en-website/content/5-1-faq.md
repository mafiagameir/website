Does Mafia kills anyone on the first night?
:  No. The game starts with Day! As the bot announces the roles in a private chat to players and mafias to other mafia players, the first Night does not exists. It means that neither Mafia kills anyone nor detector asks about anyone or doctor heals anyone.

Can someone vote to several people during a day?
: Yes.You can vote for a list of names you want to by entering on after the [vote command](#vote). For details see [vote command manual](#vote).

Can someone vote for nobody?
: Yes, Simply enter nobody after [kill command](#kill) or [vote command](#vote).


Can someone play in several games simultaneously?
: No. In this case the bot can not recognize which game are the private messages are for. That’s why the bot does not register the user on the second game unless he leaves the current game with [cancel command](#cancel) or [kill me command](#killme).

Does the bot announces identity of killed person?
: No.  To keep the game more exciting, the bot does not do that but once every two night the bot announces the game information including citizens and mafias.

Does the bot have access to all the messages in the group?
: No. the Bot is added to groups in “Privacy Mode” and just have access to messages starting with “/” character. For more information on this subject please visit [this page](https://core.telegram.org/bots/#privacy-mode).
